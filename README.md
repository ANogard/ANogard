# Hi! I'm Dmitry 👨‍💻
Here's my little code world.

I keep practicing to improve skills with Java ☕

You can find some of my work here. I keep learning new development techniques, frameworks, languages.

I'm excited to be part of a big tech-team to work with some great products, to realize myself and become code master.
